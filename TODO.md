## ðŸ”„ In Progress
- [ ] The architecture is almost fully formed (80â€“90%), but hard to describe in words. The scale is indescribable, beyond IT vocabulary, but the core idea is already there.
- [ ] Writing the core logic in `cratus.py`
- [ ] Describing all types of METAVERSE inhabitants and their roles
- [ ] Creating a `docs/` folder and protocol documentation
- [ ] Adding a visual diagram of the network structure

---

## ðŸ”œ Planned
- [ ] Implementing storage logic (block flow, replication, aging, expiration)
- [ ] Designing the CRATUScoin emission logic  
      _An absolute economic system: whatâ€™s the most valuable asset for any currency? A human.  
      A human = a consumer. But for CRATUS â€” a **citizen**._
- [ ] Building the identity system (1 person = 1 coin = 1 digital self)
- [ ] Creating a demo inhabitant (CLI or GUI interface)
- [ ] Launching a public whitepaper site
- [ ] Building a team and attracting investment
